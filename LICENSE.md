# QUANTUM COMMONS LICENSE v1.0

## 🧬 The Superpositional Software Agreement

**Version 1.0, Planck Time, 2024**

### 🌌 PREAMBLE: A QUANTUM STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES

This is not just a license. It is a **wavefunction** of legal possibilities, collapsing into enforceable terms only upon observation by a court of competent jurisdiction (or a quantum computer, whichever comes first).

By interacting with this software, you agree that:

1. **Reality is probabilistic** - The software works in some universes but not others
2. **Observation changes outcomes** - Using the software may alter its behavior
3. **Everything is entangled** - Your use affects parallel versions of yourself
4. **Cats can be both alive and dead** - We take no responsibility for feline superposition states

### 📜 ARTICLE I: GRANT OF QUANTUM RIGHTS

#### Section 1.1: Rights in All Possible Universes
We grant you permission to use, modify, and distribute this software in **any quantum state**, including but not limited to:

- In your current universe
- In parallel universes you haven't discovered yet
- In superposition (using it and not using it simultaneously)
- In entangled states with other software

#### Section 1.2: Temporal Rights (Time-Travel Clause)
You may use this software at any point in the spacetime continuum, provided you don't create paradoxes that violate the Novikov self-consistency principle. If you do, you must resolve them yourself.

#### Section 1.3: Dimensional Rights
This license extends to all dimensions from 0D (points) to 11D (M-theory). If we discover more dimensions, you get those too.

### 🔬 ARTICLE II: CONDITIONS AND OBSERVABLES

#### Section 2.1: The Attribution Wavefunction
You must maintain attribution in a state that satisfies:
```
|ψ_attribution⟩ = α|Visible⟩ + β|Hidden⟩
```
Where |α|² + |β|² = 1, and |α|² ≥ 0.3 (30% probability of being visible).

#### Section 2.2: The Copyleft Entanglement
If you distribute modified versions, they become **quantum entangled** with this original license. Any measurement of your license must collapse to include:

1. This original preamble (in spirit, if not in exact words)
2. A clear indication of changes (within Δx uncertainty)
3. No additional restrictions (unless approved by quantum arbitration)

#### Section 2.3: The Heisenberg Compatibility Principle
You may combine this software with other licensed software, provided the total **license uncertainty** ΔL remains within acceptable bounds:
```
ΔL · ΔC ≥ ħ_legal/2
```
Where ΔC is the compatibility uncertainty and ħ_legal is the legal action quantum.

### ⚠️ ARTICLE III: LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS

#### Section 3.1: The Schrödinger Warranty
**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS IS NOT"** simultaneously, in a quantum superposition of working and broken states. When you observe it, it may collapse to either.

Specifically, we provide:
- **No warranty of merchantability** (except in universes where we do)
- **No warranty of fitness for a particular purpose** (unless that purpose is quantum research)
- **No warranty that it won't create black holes** (small ones only, we promise)

#### Section 3.2: The Multiverse Liability Clause
In no event shall the authors be liable for damages arising in **any universe**, including but not limited to:

1. Direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
2. Quantum decoherence of your data
3. Unraveling of the spacetime continuum
4. Annoyance of cats put in quantum superposition
5. Existential crises from contemplating quantum mechanics

#### Section 3.3: The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Failure
If the software fails in your universe, there exists a **parallel universe** where it works perfectly. We suggest you take comfort in this probabilistic fact.

### 🧪 ARTICLE IV: QUANTUM-SPECIFIC PROVISIONS

#### Section 4.1: Quantum Copy Protection
You may not use this software to:
1. Violate the no-cloning theorem (making perfect copies of quantum states)
2. Collapse wavefunctions unnecessarily (be gentle with eigenstates)
3. Violate causality (except in closed timelike curves, which are tricky)

#### Section 4.2: The Observer Effect Acknowledgement
You acknowledge that **measuring the software changes it**. Bug reports should include the observation method used, as different measurements yield different behaviors.

#### Section 4.3: Quantum Supremacy Clause
If a quantum computer running this software achieves quantum supremacy, you must:
1. Notify us via quantum entanglement (preferred) or email
2. Share 0.0001% of any profits (adjusted for inflation across timelines)
3. Name the quantum computer after our choosing (suggestions: "Qubert" or "Quanty McQuantumface")

### 📡 ARTICLE V: ENFORCEMENT AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

#### Section 5.1: Jurisdiction
Disputes shall be resolved in:
1. The International Court of Quantum Justice (if it exists)
2. The user's local jurisdiction (classical fallback)
3. A quantum arbitration circuit (to be designed)

#### Section 5.2: The Quantum Legal Principle
All legal interpretations of this license must respect the **principle of quantum legal uncertainty**:
> The more precisely a term is defined, the less certain its enforcement becomes.

#### Section 5.3: Amendments
This license may be amended by:
1. **Quantum vote**: All users across all timelines vote simultaneously
2. **Temporal recursion**: Future versions amend past versions via closed timelike curves
3. **Consensus of major parallel universes**: If 51% of major universes agree

### 📝 ARTICLE VI: CLASSICAL FALLOVER CLAUSE

#### Section 6.1: When Quantum Mechanics Fails
In the event that quantum mechanics is proven incorrect, invalid, or otherwise unsatisfactory, this license reverts to the **MIT License** with the following additions:

1. You must include a note saying "Formerly quantum"
2. You get a 10% discount on any future quantum licenses
3. Schrödinger's cat is declared definitively alive (we're optimists)

### 🐱 ARTICLE VII: THE SCHRÖDINGER PROTOCOL

#### Section 7.1: Feline Considerations
No animals were harmed in the making of this software, though some may exist in superpositional states. If you use this software with actual cats, please:

1. Provide adequate treats in all quantum states
2. Pet them in a manner that doesn't collapse their wavefunctions
3. Name at least one variable after a cat in your code

### 🎯 ARTICLE VIII: ACCEPTANCE

By using this software, you agree that:

1. You have read and understood this license (or at least pretended to)
2. You agree to be bound by it in this and all parallel universes
3. You acknowledge that "understanding quantum mechanics" is a spectrum
4. You won't sue us for the existential dread this may cause

#### Section 8.1: The Copenhagen Interpretation of Acceptance
Your acceptance exists in superposition until measured by a court. At that point, it collapses to either "accepted" or "not accepted," with probabilities determined by legal precedent and quantum fluctuation.

## 🌟 FINAL PROVISIONS

### Severability
If any provision of this license is found to be unenforceable in your universe, it remains enforceable in parallel universes where it is valid. You are responsible for compliance in the majority of accessible universes.

### Entire Agreement
This license represents the complete agreement between parties across the **multiverse**. Any previous agreements, understandings, or quantum entanglements are hereby superseded.

### Notification of Quantum Events
If you experience any of the following while using this software:
- Spontaneous quantum tunneling
- Unintended time travel
- Communication with parallel selves
- Sudden understanding of quantum gravity

Please file an issue on GitHub (use label: `quantum-weirdness`).

## ⚖️ LEGALESE TRANSLATION FOR CLASSICAL COURTS

*Notwithstanding the quantum humor herein, this is a legitimate open-source license granting permissions similar to the MIT License, with added protections for the authors against quantum-related damages. In classical legal terms: use at your own risk, give credit, don't sue us for quantum phenomena.*

**Equivalent to: MIT License + Quantum Waiver + Humor Clause**
